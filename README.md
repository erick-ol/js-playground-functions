## Playground Functions

This was a project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web) as a challenge while I was learning how to use JavaScript and how to have programming logic. Made on ```June 2, 2021```

### How to download and run the project code

First of all you need to download the project files, you can do this using git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:erick-ol/js-playground-functions.git
```

Then you just need to enter the application folder and open your ```src/challenge.js``` file to test the functions.
